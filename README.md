# Watchguard Tool

## TL;DR

This is a tool for the irritating watchguard problem on GPRA-IITJ network.

To start using the tool instantly:

* Fill up the **config.json** file with valid [username, password] combinations.
* `cd` to the repository directory and run `python wgtool.py &` in the command line.

This will add a system tray icon and start the tool in `Auto` mode.

## Configuration

The configuration data is written in `config.json`.

The first object has a list of `username: password` pairs
that are used by the tool for logging in. When the user clicks `Login` from the tray icon menu, it automatically
checks all the mentioned usernames and logs in with the first valid hit.

The second object currently has the `timeout` value only. When the tool is in `Auto` mode, it rechecks if the user
is logged into watchguard portal every `k` seconds, `k` being the timeout value, and logs the user in if not
already logged in. **Default timeout value is 30 seconds**.
This second object can have more configuration options as per the needs.

## Resources Used

`wgtool.py` is the main driving script, and `wutility.py` has all the required definitions.
Some of the primary modules and methods used are:

* `gtk`, `gobject`, `notify` and `appindicator` from `gi.repository`
* `urllib2`
* `requests`
* `json.load`

To run this app on startup, we can write a new small `wgtool.conf` file and put it in /etc/init to hook
into the upstart service that runs services on startup. Then we can also `sudo service wgtool start/stop`.

## Configuration for the .conf file

There is file named `watch.conf` has been added to configure this according to your script location just change the 
path in the command attribute

For running this conf file you will have install supervisior.
For Debian User:
`sudo apt-get install supervisor`

and put this conf file in the folder `/etc/supervisor/conf.d`

.
